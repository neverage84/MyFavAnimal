<p>Hedgehogs have gained popularity as pets in recent decades. Before you add one to your family, Dr. Krista Keller, a veterinarian at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Urbana, recommends learning all you can about these animalsâ€™ unique needs.</p>

<p>While the wild European hedgehog freely roams the gardens of the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the species that is raised for the pet trade is the African pygmy hedgehog, Atelerix albiventris, according to Dr. Keller, who is board certified by the American College of Zoological Medicine.</p>
